						Tradition is used as scaffolding to ground a culture’s identity during times of change. The recollection (or formation) of tradition occurs more frequently under rapid transformations in society, or when a way of life feels threatened. Unstable social climates, such as industrialization in 19th century Britain, or the rapidly expanding 21st century digital age, threaten to destroy existing traditions. Because of this, new traditions are updated, or as Hobsbawm and Ranger would suggest, ‘invented,’ to resist the contemporary climate. During the Industrial Revolution, some people looked to historical examples of art and design as a way of trying to return to a romanticized moral home, a way of maintaining self-identity as the world changed. Through the practice of Gothic Revival design, the focus of craft in the Arts and Craft movement, and the role of textiles in the ideological competition between industrial manufacture and traditional techniques and motifs, it is clear that throughout the past 200 years of Western society, traditions are oftentimes invented or repurposed to create and anchor a group identity with a set of moral values that oppose large scale social change and progress. Tradition is used dually by traditionalists and progressive parties to accomplish their goals, with both groups appropriating and recontextualising historic ‘tradition’ to produce reception in audiences. It may even be suggested that by inventing traditions, the act of dislodging aesthetics from their original purpose and meaning, and applying new contexts, makes them more susceptible to appropriation and repurposing in industry, and furthermore weakens the original meaning of the style they pull from.

						Tradition is used as scaffolding to ground a culture’s identity during times of change. The recollection (or formation) of tradition occurs more frequently under rapid transformations in society, or when a way of life feels threatened. Unstable social climates, such as industrialization in 19th century Britain, or the rapidly expanding 21st century digital age, threaten to destroy existing traditions. Because of this, new traditions are updated, or as Hobsbawm and Ranger would suggest, ‘invented,’ to resist the contemporary climate. During the Industrial Revolution, some people looked to historical examples of art and design as a way of trying to return to a romanticized moral home, a way of maintaining self-identity as the world changed. Through the practice of Gothic Revival design, the focus of craft in the Arts and Craft movement, and the role of textiles in the ideological competition between industrial manufacture and traditional techniques and motifs, it is clear that throughout the past 200 years of Western society, traditions are oftentimes invented or repurposed to create and anchor a group identity with a set of moral values that oppose large scale social change and progress. Tradition is used dually by traditionalists and progressive parties to accomplish their goals, with both groups appropriating and recontextualising historic ‘tradition’ to produce reception in audiences. It may even be suggested that by inventing traditions, the act of dislodging aesthetics from their original purpose and meaning, and applying new contexts, makes them more susceptible to appropriation and repurposing in industry, and furthermore weakens the original meaning of the style they pull from.

						Tradition is used as scaffolding to ground a culture’s identity during times of change. The recollection (or formation) of tradition occurs more frequently under rapid transformations in society, or when a way of life feels threatened. Unstable social climates, such as industrialization in 19th century Britain, or the rapidly expanding 21st century digital age, threaten to destroy existing traditions. Because of this, new traditions are updated, or as Hobsbawm and Ranger would suggest, ‘invented,’ to resist the contemporary climate. During the Industrial Revolution, some people looked to historical examples of art and design as a way of trying to return to a romanticized moral home, a way of maintaining self-identity as the world changed. Through the practice of Gothic Revival design, the focus of craft in the Arts and Craft movement, and the role of textiles in the ideological competition between industrial manufacture and traditional techniques and motifs, it is clear that throughout the past 200 years of Western society, traditions are oftentimes invented or repurposed to create and anchor a group identity with a set of moral values that oppose large scale social change and progress. Tradition is used dually by traditionalists and progressive parties to accomplish their goals, with both groups appropriating and recontextualising historic ‘tradition’ to produce reception in audiences. It may even be suggested that by inventing traditions, the act of dislodging aesthetics from their original purpose and meaning, and applying new contexts, makes them more susceptible to appropriation and repurposing in industry, and furthermore weakens the original meaning of the style they pull from.

During the Industrial Revolution, some people looked to historical examples of art and design as a way of trying to return to a romanticized moral home, a way of maintaining self-identity as the world changed. Through the practice of Gothic Revival design, the focus of craft in the Arts and Craft movement, and the role of textiles in the ideological competition between industrial manufacture and traditional techniques and motifs, it is clear that throughout the past 200 years of Western society, traditions are oftentimes invented or repurposed to create and anchor a group identity with a set of moral values that oppose large scale social change and progress. Tradition is used dually by traditionalists and progressive parties to accomplish their goals, with both groups appropriating and recontextualising historic ‘tradition’ to produce reception in audiences. It may even be suggested that by inventing traditions, the act of dislodging aesthetics from their original purpose and meaning, and applying new contexts, makes them more susceptible to appropriation and repurposing in industry, and furthermore weakens the original meaning of the style they pull from.

						Tradition is used as scaffolding to ground a culture’s identity during times of change.

Unstable social climates, such as industrialization in 19th century Britain, or the rapidly expanding 21st century digital age, threaten to destroy existing traditions.
